Thanks for signing up for an account at JoinSend.com . Does Sierra Media need a courier services this week?

We are always looking for feedback from early adopters. If you have a couple minutes, would you mind helping out by answering these 2 questions?

1. Does Sierra Media use couriers or were you looking for a personal delivery?
2. Did you receive an automatic price quote? If so, what are you feelings on our pricing?

Thanks!
